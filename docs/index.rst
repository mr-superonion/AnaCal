AnaCal: A fast, accurate shear estimator
======================================

Analytic Calibration for Perturbation Estimation from Galaxy Images.

This framework is devised to bridge various analytic shear estimators that have
been developed or are anticipated to be created in the future. We intend to
develop a suite of analytical shear estimators capable of inferring shear with
subpercent accuracy, all while maintaining minimal computational time. The
currently supported analytic shear estimators are:
